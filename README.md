# Surfs Up!
## Overview
W.Avy is an entrepeneur looking to open a Surf & Ice Cream Shop in Oahu, HI. An while he has experience in the area needs to have a wise understanding of the weather in the area and estimate how it will affect the affluence of visitors to the area and prospect customers. 

For the reasons above mentioned we are presenting an Analysis of weather data using Python, Pandas, Flask and SQLite to forecast economic performance in the area and how the weather affects such performance. We hope our analysis paints a clear picture of how the shop may perform and draw inverstors to participate in such venture.

## Results
We decided to analyze two separate months 6 Months appart June and December which should present us with very different weather conditions.

For the Month of June we found we had 17,000 temperature readings with the Max temperature being 85 and the Minimum 64 Degrees Farenheight.

For the Month of December we encountered that the Max temperature was 83 and the Minimum 56 Degrees Farenheight.

By performing this analysis we discovered some key knowledge that will help us determine the best time to open the shop and how much the weather changes during the different seasons.

* Weather in Oahu is somewhat constant and doesnt change too drastically comparing June and December, being the highest temperature only 2 degrees appart in avarege, and the lowest 8 degrees appart.

* In average the weather in Oahu during June is 75 Degrees Farenheight and December 71 Degrees Farenheight.

* Ice Cream Consumption may be affected since the weather is not too hot. Ice cream portion of the business shouldn't be the main source of income. Possibly should create a more profitable source of income such as surfing classes, paddleboarding tours or snorkeling to help overcome any financial shortcomings.

## Summary

Oahu seems like a perfect location to open up a Surf and Ice Cream Shop, the weather seems to be very consistent and the paradise-like beaches present with the opportunity to draw a large crowd of Tourists and Surfing Enthusiasts. 

To have a better understanding of the terrain and weather in Oahu, in future analysis we could include Wind-Speed as it influences the waves and ability of surfers to be on the water and possibly a count of how many days are Rain days and could make the Surfing virtually impossible in the area.
